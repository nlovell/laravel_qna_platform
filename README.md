# Laravel: Complete Guide to Laravel
Apparently it's a good idea to learn more languages. I agree.

This repository contains the code and project files generated as part of the Udemy course I'm currently following - [link here](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-path-laravel-complete-guide-to-laravel/learn/lecture/9641472#overview)
The ReadMe is mostly for my own benefit, so I can remember what I've been doing.

## Installing Laravel

Requirements:

- Install XAMPP
- Install PHP 7
- Install Composer

The webserver is run with `php artisan serve`

## What I've Been Doing
These notes are here so that I can quickly see at a glance what's been going on in the course.

### Section 1: Getting to Grips

#### 1 through 4: Introduction
It was a bit of preamble talking about Laravel, configuration, and why we use MVC stuff. Easy.

#### 5: Setting up some new routes
Apparently the course hasn't been updated for PHP8 yet, but aside from that it was easy enough.

#### 6


## Deviations from the course

- Project name is `TerribleAnswers`, because the course subtitles said so.
